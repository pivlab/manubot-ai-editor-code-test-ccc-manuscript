### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx version 8 data for all tissues and normalized it using TPM (transcripts per million).
Our primary analysis focused on whole blood, which had a sample size of 755.
From whole blood, we selected the top 5,000 genes with the largest variance after standardizing with $\log(x + 1)$ to prevent bias towards highly-expressed genes.
Subsequently, we calculated Pearson, Spearman, MIC, and CCC for these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data.
This computation resulted in a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000. 

$$TPM = \frac{F}{L} \times 10^6 {#eq1}$$

Where:
- $TPM$ = Transcripts per million
- $F$ = Number of fragments mapped to a gene
- $L$ = Gene length
