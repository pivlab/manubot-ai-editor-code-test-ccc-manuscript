### The CCC reveals linear and nonlinear patterns in human transcriptomic data

We next examined the characteristics of these correlation coefficients in gene expression data from GTEx v8 across different tissues.
We selected the top 5,000 genes with the largest variance for our initial analyses on whole blood and then computed the correlation matrix between genes using Pearson, Spearman and CCC (see [Methods](#sec:data_gtex)).


We analyzed the absolute values of each correlation coefficient in the GTEx dataset, as shown in Figure @fig:dist_coefs.
The CCC (Concordance Correlation Coefficient) displayed a skewed distribution with a mean of 0.14, median of 0.08, and standard deviation of 0.15.
This distribution was more skewed compared to Pearson's (mean=0.31, median=0.24, sd=0.24) and Spearman's (mean=0.39, median=0.37, sd=0.26) coefficients.
To capture 70% of gene pair correlations, the thresholds for CCC, Pearson, and Spearman were 0.18, 0.44, and 0.56, respectively, as depicted in Figure @fig:dist_coefs b.
This indicates that these coefficients' magnitudes are not directly comparable, leading us to use ranking for further analysis.
In the GTEx v8 dataset, CCC values were more aligned with Spearman's than with Pearson's, as illustrated in Figure @fig:dist_coefs c.

Additionally, we evaluated the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) in this context (refer to [Supplementary Note 1](#sec:mic)).
Our analysis revealed that CCC's performance was similar to MIC's but was significantly faster, taking up to two orders of magnitude less time (detailed in [Supplementary Note 2](#sec:time_test)).
Given MIC's capability to detect a wide range of patterns beyond linear relationships and its proven effectiveness across different studies, our results imply that CCC's applicability may extend to the broader capabilities of MIC.
Consequently, our further analyses will concentrate on comparing CCC with traditional linear correlation coefficients.

Upon examining gene pairs that were either highlighted or overlooked by these correlation coefficients, it became evident that they identified distinct patterns.
We assessed the level of agreement and disagreement among the coefficients by selecting the top 30% of gene pairs with the highest correlation values (termed the "high" set) and the bottom 30% (the "low" set) for each coefficient.
This process generated six categories that might overlap.
In the majority of cases (76.4%), an UpSet analysis (illustrated in Figure 1a) demonstrated that the three coefficients concurred on the presence of a strong correlation (42.1%) or the absence of a relationship (34.3%).
Given that Pearson and Spearman coefficients only detect linear relationships, while the CCC (Comprehensive Correlation Coefficient) can identify both linear and non-linear patterns, it is likely that these agreements pertain to clear linear relationships.
The CCC and Spearman coefficients showed more agreement on gene pairs with either high or low correlation (4.0% in the "high" set and 7.0% in the "low" set) compared to their agreement with Pearson (ranging from 0.3% to 3.5% for the "high" set and 2.8% to 5.5% for the "low" set).
To summarize, the CCC was in agreement with either Pearson or Spearman for 90.5% of the gene pairs, assigning them either a high or low correlation value.

**Intersection of gene pairs with high and low correlation coefficient values (GTEx v8, whole blood).**
**a)** UpSet plot with six categories (rows) grouping the 30% of the highest (green triangle) and lowest (red triangle) values for each coefficient.
Columns show different intersections of categories grouped by agreements and disagreements.
**b)** Hexagonal binning plots with examples of gene pairs where CCC ($c$) disagrees with Pearson ($p$) and Spearman ($s$).
For each method, colors in the triangles indicate if the gene pair is among the top (green) or bottom (red) 30% of coefficient values.
No triangle means that the correlation value for the gene pair is between the 30th and 70th percentiles (neither low nor high).
A logarithmic scale was used to color each hexagon.

Our analysis revealed that while there was a general consensus, over 20,000 gene pairs identified with a high CCC (Concordance Correlation Coefficient) value were not similarly ranked by other correlation coefficients, as shown in the right section of Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs a.
Additionally, we found gene pairs that had a high Pearson correlation coefficient but displayed either a low CCC (1,075 pairs), a low Spearman coefficient (87 pairs), or both low CCC and Spearman coefficients (531 pairs).
Our further investigation indicated that many of these discrepancies might be attributed to potential outliers, as detailed in Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b.
Specifically, we focused on analyzing gene pairs that ranked in the top five of each category within the "Disagreements" group (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs a, right side), where the CCC value did not align with either Pearson, Spearman, or both coefficients.

**The expression levels of *KDM6A* and *UTY* display sex-specific associations across GTEx tissues.**
CCC captures this nonlinear relationship in all GTEx tissues (nine examples are shown in the first three rows), except in female-specific organs (last row).
](images/coefs_comp/kdm6a_vs_uty/gtex-KDM6A_vs_UTY-main.svg "KDM6A and UTY across different GTEx tissues"){#fig:gtex_tissues:kdm6a_uty width="95%"}

The initial analysis focused on three gene pairs (*IFNG* - *SDS*, *JUN* - *APOC1*, and *ZDHHC12* - *CCL18*) that demonstrated a unique relationship characterized by high CCC (Cyclic Coordination Coefficient) and low Pearson correlation values.
This pattern indicates a possible inhibitory effect where one gene's high expression corresponds to the other's low expression, and vice versa.
Subsequently, another set of three gene pairs (*UTY* - *KDM6A*, *RASSF2* - *CYTIP*, and *AC068580.6* - *KLHL21*) exhibited a mix of linear and non-linear or independent relationships.
Notably, the paralogous genes *UTY* and *KDM6A* showed a complex relationship.
In some samples, these genes displayed a strong linear correlation, while in others, one gene remained consistently expressed regardless of the other's expression level.
This pattern is attributed to the genes' chromosomal locations, with *UTY* on the Y chromosome and *KDM6A* on the X chromosome, leading to gender-specific expression patterns.
Males exhibited a linear relationship between these genes, whereas females showed no expression for *UTY*.
The CCC effectively captured this nuanced relationship (c=0.29), outperforming both Pearson (p=0.24) and Spearman (s=0.10) correlation coefficients.
Moreover, this gene pair's pattern was consistently identified by CCC across various tissues in the GTEx dataset, except in female-specific organs, as illustrated in Figure @fig:gtex_tissues:kdm6a_uty.
