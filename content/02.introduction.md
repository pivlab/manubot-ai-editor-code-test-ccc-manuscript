New technologies have vastly improved data collection, generating a deluge of information across different disciplines.
This large amount of data provides new opportunities to address unanswered scientific questions, provided we have efficient tools capable of identifying multiple types of underlying patterns.
Correlation analysis is an essential statistical technique for discovering relationships between variables [@pmid:21310971].
Correlation coefficients are often used in exploratory data mining techniques, such as clustering or community detection algorithms, to compute a similarity value between a pair of objects of interest such as genes [@pmid:27479844] or disease-relevant lifestyle factors [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1217269109].
Correlation methods are also used in supervised tasks, for example, for feature selection to improve prediction accuracy [@pmid:27006077; @pmid:33729976].
The Pearson correlation coefficient is ubiquitously deployed across application domains and diverse scientific areas.
Thus, even minor and significant improvements in these techniques could have enormous consequences in industry and research.



In the field of transcriptomics, the journey often begins by exploring how genes are related to each other.
This exploration is crucial as understanding gene correlations can lead to significant insights.
For instance, it can help predict the function of genes, assist in identifying regulatory networks that are common across or specific to certain cell types, and reveal interactions within organisms that might explain molecular mechanisms applicable to other species.
These insights come from studies that have laid the groundwork in this area.

The analysis of extensive RNA sequencing data has the potential to uncover intricate transcriptional mechanisms that play a role in human diseases.
This is particularly evident since the introduction of the omnigenic model, which has shifted the focus towards understanding the complex interactions between genes in the context of human health.
This model suggests that gene-gene relationships are increasingly crucial in the study of diseases, including the development of polygenic risk scores, which are used to assess an individual's susceptibility to diseases based on their genetic makeup.

Recent methodologies have started integrating information from genome-wide association studies, which identify genes associated with diseases, with gene co-expression networks.
This integration aims to highlight "core" genes that have a direct impact on diseases.
These core genes are often overlooked by traditional statistical methods but are believed to be central to interconnected networks relevant to disease regulation.
As a result, there is a growing need for advanced correlation coefficients that can capture not only linear but also complex relationships between genes.
Such tools could revolutionize various biological fields by aiding in the identification of potential drug targets for precision medicine, among other applications.


The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are popular tools for identifying straightforward relationships because they are intuitive and quick to calculate.
However, they mainly detect linear or monotonic patterns and often overlook complex yet essential relationships.
To address this limitation, new metrics like the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and the Distance Correlation (DC) have been introduced to identify nonlinear patterns.
MIC, in particular, has been widely applied in various fields, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex relationships.
Despite their advantages, these metrics can be computationally demanding, making them less practical for large datasets.
For example, computing MIC for a single pair of variables across thousands of objects can take several seconds.

In our previous work, we developed a clustering method that outperformed traditional approaches, including Pearson, Spearman, DC, and MIC, in identifying clusters of both linear and nonlinear relationships under different noise conditions.
Building on this, we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient method that is not limited to linear relationships and can handle both quantitative and qualitative variables.
The CCC has a single parameter that controls the complexity of relationships it can detect, from linear to more complex patterns, while also managing computation time.
This approach allows users to tailor the detection of patterns to their specific needs while providing default settings for general relationship identification.
Our CCC implementation is designed for high performance, capable of processing millions of variable pairs swiftly due to its parallelizable nature.

We tested CCC on gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression v8 (GTEx) project, where it successfully identified both strong linear and previously unnoticed nonlinear patterns.
For instance, CCC revealed nonlinear patterns related to sex differences in gene expression, indicating its potential to uncover significant relationships in specific sample subsets.
Additionally, CCC proved to be faster than MIC while delivering comparable results.
Gene pairs identified by CCC in expression data showed higher interaction probabilities in tissue-specific gene networks, as seen in the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) project.
The ability of CCC to efficiently process diverse data types, including numerical and categorical features, minimizes the need for data preprocessing and makes it an attractive option for analyzing large and varied datasets.
