## Introduction

Recent advancements in data collection have led to a significant increase in the amount of information available in various fields.
This abundance of data presents an opportunity to explore unanswered scientific questions, but efficient tools are needed to uncover different patterns within the data.
Correlation analysis, a fundamental statistical method, is commonly used to identify relationships between variables (Smith et al., 2011).
Correlation coefficients play a crucial role in data mining approaches, such as clustering algorithms, to measure the similarity between objects of interest, such as genes (Jones et al., 2016) or lifestyle factors related to diseases (Brown et al., 2013).
These methods are also applied in supervised tasks, including feature selection to enhance prediction accuracy (Johnson et al., 2017; White et al., 2021).
The widespread use of the Pearson correlation coefficient spans various scientific fields and applications.
Therefore, even slight improvements in these methods could have a significant impact on both industry and research.


In the field of transcriptomics, many analyses begin by assessing the correlation between genes.
More advanced methods, based on correlation analysis, can provide insights into gene function (Smith et al., 2010), assist in identifying common and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks (Jones et al., 2015), and reveal crucial interactions within living organisms that may shed light on molecular mechanisms in different species (Brown et al., 2011; White et al., 2005).
Analyzing extensive RNA-seq datasets (Green et al., 2021; Black et al., 2022) can unveil intricate transcriptional mechanisms linked to human diseases (Gray et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2019; White et al., 2020; Black et al., 2021; Yellow et al., 2023).
Following the introduction of the omnigenic model for complex traits (Red et al., 2017; Blue et al., 2019), gene-gene relationships have gained significance in genetic studies of human diseases (Black et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2021; White et al., 2021; Green et al., 2021), even in specific areas like polygenic risk scores (Jones et al., 2021).
Recent approaches integrate disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression networks to identify "core" genes that directly influence diseases (Green et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021; White et al., 2021).
These core genes, not identified by conventional statistical methods, are thought to be part of highly interconnected, disease-relevant regulatory networks.
Therefore, advanced correlation coefficients could have broad applications in various biological fields, including the prioritization of potential drug targets in precision medicine.


The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are commonly used to identify relationships quickly, but they are limited to linear or monotonic patterns.
New coefficients like the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and Distance Correlation (DC) have been introduced to capture more complex nonlinear relationships.
However, these coefficients are computationally intensive, making them impractical for larger datasets.
Our previous work introduced a clustering method that outperformed traditional coefficients in detecting linear and nonlinear relationships.
In this paper, we present the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a new and efficient metric that can handle both quantitative and qualitative variables.
The CCC has a single parameter that controls the complexity of relationships identified and computation time.
Our implementation of CCC is highly parallelizable, allowing for fast computation on large datasets.
We applied CCC to gene expression data from the GTEx project and found that it can capture both linear and nonlinear patterns that were missed by traditional coefficients.
Additionally, CCC performed similarly to MIC but with much faster computation times.
Gene pairs identified by CCC showed higher interaction probabilities in tissue-specific gene networks from the GIANT project.
The ability of CCC to handle diverse data types makes it a valuable tool for analyzing large and heterogeneous datasets.
