### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

In our study, we aimed to verify if gene associations found in the GTEx dataset could also be identified in other datasets.
Typically, gene co-expression analyses rely on linear correlation coefficients, which may not capture all types of relationships.
To overcome this limitation, we utilized 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the GIANT database, which do not include GTEx samples, ensuring an independent replication effort.
These networks represent genes and their interactions across various biological processes, derived from multiple data types like protein interactions and microRNA target profiles found in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

We focused on gene pairs highly ranked by three different correlation coefficients in GTEx's whole blood tissue (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs) and checked if these relationships held in similar tissues or cell types in the GIANT networks.
GIANT's machine learning algorithm helped identify relevant tissues or cell types for specific gene pairs, enhancing our analysis's accuracy.

For instance, the gene pair *RASSF2* - *CYTIP*, with a high CCC score, showed strong connections within the blood network, indicating a significant interaction (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a).
The detected cell type for this pair was leukocytes, with interaction scores supporting their strong association in the blood network.
Conversely, the pair *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2*, which had a high Pearson but low CCC score, was part of less cohesive networks (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b), suggesting weaker associations.
The automatically detected cell type for this pair was skeletal muscle, differing from the blood or its cell lineages.

These findings suggest that the CCC might better capture specific patterns within blood-related gene interactions, potentially overlooked by other coefficients.
This highlights the importance of considering non-linear relationships in gene expression studies to uncover more nuanced biological insights.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:

In our study, we conducted a detailed evaluation of the top 100 gene pairs that showed the most significant differences when comparing the new correlation coefficient (CCC) with two other commonly used coefficients.
We focused on gene pairs identified in GTEx (whole blood) and utilized GIANT to automatically determine if these genes were likely to be expressed in cell types relevant to blood.
Specifically, we looked at the five most frequently identified cell types for each coefficient and examined the connectivity within these networks (refer to [Methods](#sec:giant)).

Our findings revealed that the top-ranked gene pairs by CCC, unlike those ranked by the other coefficients, were associated with blood-specific cell types such as macrophages, leukocytes, natural killer cells, blood, and mononuclear phagocytes (see Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left).
These CCC-identified networks showed a significantly higher average probability of gene interaction compared to networks formed by other coefficients, with medians exceeding 67% and first quartiles over 41% for all predicted cell types (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right).

In contrast, gene pairs highly ranked by Pearson's coefficient were often linked to tissues not related to blood, with skeletal muscle being the most common prediction (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left).
The probability of interaction within these Pearson-identified networks was generally lower than those identified by CCC, except for the few that were blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom right).

Our analysis indicates that gene associations uniquely identified by CCC in whole blood are more robustly replicated in networks that integrate multiple data types.
These CCC-ranked gene pairs not only show a high likelihood of sharing the same biological process but are also specifically expressed in blood-related cell types.
On the other hand, most gene pairs ranked highly by Pearson's coefficient did not show a preference for blood-related expression, and their interaction probabilities were relatively low.
This discrepancy suggests that Pearson's top-ranked gene pairs in GTEx may predominantly reflect outlier effects, aligning with our previous observations of outlier-driven associations (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b).
