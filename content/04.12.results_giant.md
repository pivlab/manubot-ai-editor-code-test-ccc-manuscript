### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We analyzed discrepant scores to determine if associations were consistent across datasets beyond GTEx.
Using 144 tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT, where nodes represent genes and edges represent functional relationships weighted with probabilities of interaction, we examined gene pairs in whole blood (Figure 1).
These networks were constructed from various interaction measurements, including protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, chemical/genetic perturbations, and microRNA target profiles from MSigDB.
Highly-ranked gene pairs in blood that showed real patterns were expected to replicate in related tissues or cell lineages using GIANT's multi-cell type functional interaction networks.
For example, gene pairs *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* with a high CCC value and gene pairs *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* with high Pearson values were analyzed.
The networks revealed strong connections for *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* in blood and leukocytes, while *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* showed weaker connections in skeletal muscle.
These findings suggest that CCC may capture tissue-specific patterns not detected by other coefficients.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:

We systematically evaluated the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and two other coefficients.
Using GTEx data for whole blood, we identified relevant cell types for each gene pair through GIANT analysis.
The top five predicted cell types for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were all blood-specific, including macrophage, leukocyte, natural killer cell, blood, and mononuclear phagocyte (Figure 1c, top left).
The average probability of interaction between genes in CCC-ranked networks was significantly higher compared to other coefficients, with medians above 67% and first quartiles above 41% across predicted cell types (Figure 1c, top right).
In contrast, most Pearson's gene pairs were predicted to be specific to non-blood tissues, with skeletal muscle being the most common prediction (Figure 1c, bottom left).
Interaction probabilities in Pearson-ranked networks were generally lower than CCC, except for blood-specific gene pairs (Figure 1c, bottom right).
The associations exclusively detected by CCC in GTEx whole blood were strongly replicated in independent networks incorporating multiple data modalities.
CCC-ranked gene pairs not only shared high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process but were also specific to blood cell lineages.
Conversely, Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not blood-specific, with lower interaction probabilities.
Lack of replication in GIANT suggests that top Pearson-ranked gene pairs in GTEx may be mainly driven by outliers, consistent with earlier observations of outlier-driven associations (Figure 2b).
