### Tissue-specific network analyses using GIANT {#sec:giant}

We utilized the tissue-specific gene networks from the Genomics Integrated Analysis of Networks in Tissues (GIANT) platform, engaging both its web interface and web services as provided by HumanBase [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org].
The version of GIANT employed in our study encompasses 987 genome-scale datasets, covering approximately 38,000 conditions derived from around 14,000 publications.
The methodology for constructing these networks is elaborately detailed in [@doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
In summary, the construction of tissue-specific gene networks involved the integration of gene expression data (excluding GTEx samples [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/data]) sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [@doi:10.1093/nar/gks1193], alongside data on protein-protein interactions from databases such as BioGRID [@pmc:PMC3531226], IntAct [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkr1088], MINT [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkr930], and MIPS [@pmc:PMC148093].
Additionally, transcription factor regulation was analyzed using binding motifs from JASPAR [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkp950], and the effects of chemical and genetic perturbations were incorporated from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0506580102].
The gene expression data underwent logarithmic transformation, followed by the computation of the Pearson correlation for each gene pair.
This correlation was then normalized employing the Fisher's z transform:

$$
z = \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1 + r}{1 - r}\right)
$$ {#eq:fisher_transform}

where \(r\) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Subsequently, the resulting z-scores were discretized into several bins.
We established gold standards for tissue-specific functional relationships through expert curation and the utilization of experimentally derived gene annotations from the Gene Ontology.
Each of the 144 tissues had a naive Bayesian classifier trained on these gold standards, utilizing C++ implementations from the Sleipnir library [@pmid:18499696].
These classifiers were then applied to estimate the probability of tissue-specific interactions for each gene pair, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of gene network dynamics within specific tissue contexts.


In our study, we prioritized pairs of genes using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database.
For each of these pairs, we utilized the GeneMANIA algorithm available through HumanBase to derive 1) a predicted gene network specific to blood, which was manually selected to correspond with the whole blood samples in GTEx, and 2) a gene network predicted for an automatically determined tissue type.
This automatic tissue prediction was implemented using the methodology delineated by Greene et al.
[@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113], facilitated through the HumanBase web interfaces and services.
This method succinctly involves training a machine learning model with extensive transcriptional datasets, using human-curated markers for various cell lineages (such as macrophages) as the gold standard.
The trained models are then employed to predict genes specific to other cell lineages.
In addition to identifying the predicted tissue or cell lineage, we calculated the average probability of interaction among all genes within the network sourced from GIANT.
Consistent with the standard protocol adopted by GIANT, for each network, we selected the top 15 genes demonstrating the highest probability of interaction with the gene pair under consideration.

This approach allowed us to systematically explore the intricate web of gene interactions within specific tissue contexts, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of gene networks relevant to our study.
By leveraging the predictive power of machine learning models trained on comprehensive transcriptional data, we were able to generate insights into cell lineage-specific gene expressions and their potential interactions, an endeavor that is crucial for unraveling the complex genetic underpinnings of various biological processes and diseases.
