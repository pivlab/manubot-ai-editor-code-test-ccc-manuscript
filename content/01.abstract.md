## Abstract {.page_break_before}

In transcriptomics, identifying patterns in gene expression data is crucial for understanding biological processes.
The traditional linear correlation coefficients may not capture all the complexities in gene relationships.
To address this, we propose the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a machine learning-based coefficient that can reveal both linear and nonlinear patterns efficiently.
Compared to standard coefficients like the Maximal Information Coefficient, CCC is faster and can detect biologically meaningful patterns that are missed by linear-only methods.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC not only identifies robust linear relationships but also uncovers nonlinear patterns, such as sex differences.
Additionally, CCC can detect functional relationships between genes that are overlooked by linear-only methods, as shown by enrichment in integrated networks.
Overall, CCC is a versatile and efficient tool that can be applied to genome-scale data and various data types to uncover hidden relationships.
