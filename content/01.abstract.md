## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Correlation coefficients play a crucial role in uncovering patterns within datasets, particularly in transcriptomics where correlated gene expressions often indicate shared functions or involvement in disease-related biological pathways.
In this study, we present the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a novel, efficient, and user-friendly correlation coefficient that leverages machine learning models to detect both linear and nonlinear relationships in data.
Unlike traditional correlation coefficients that are limited to linear associations, the CCC is designed to unearth biologically significant patterns that these linear-only coefficients overlook.
By comparing clustering solutions, CCC efficiently captures general patterns across datasets, proving to be faster than advanced coefficients like the Maximal Information Coefficient.
When tested on human gene expression data, CCC not only identified strong linear relationships but also uncovered nonlinear patterns linked to sex differences, which linear-only coefficients failed to detect.
Furthermore, gene pairs highly ranked by CCC showed enrichment for interactions within integrated networks, including protein-protein interactions, transcription factor regulations, and chemical and genetic perturbations.
This indicates that CCC is capable of identifying functional relationships overlooked by linear-only methods.
Overall, CCC represents a highly efficient, cutting-edge correlation coefficient that excels in analyzing genome-scale data and can be applied across various domains and data types.
